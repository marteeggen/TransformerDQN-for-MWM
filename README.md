# Transformer deep Q-network for solving navigation in the Morris Water Maze 🐁

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent designed to navigate in a simulated 2D version of the Morris Water Maze, a neuroscientific experiment for spatial learning. The agent architecture is a decoder-only transformer serving as a deep Q-network.
